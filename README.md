Some tools for my students that are designed to guide cracks rather than do the entire crack on their own.  Much of these are hacked together rather than carefully coded, so expect bugs and strange behavior.

Enigma Encryptor.exe is a prototype guided crack through the Enigma machine using Marian Rejewski's method.  It's pretty bare-bones at the moment.
